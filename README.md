# dlang_raylib

[D](https://dlang.org) bindings to the [raylib](https://raylib.com) library.

## Code style

This bindings have been literally copied from the C header file, so you
can expect the D identifiers to match the original library ones.

For everything else which is not connected to this library, the standard
[D style conventions](https://dlang.org/dstyle.html) are followed.

## Documentation

Unlike the other D bindings this is documented with the original C
comments since this is an almost exact copy of the header file.
With that said, you can always refer to the [cheatsheet](https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html)
to get a broader view of the modules.
